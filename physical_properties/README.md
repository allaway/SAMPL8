We recently finalized work with GSK on data collection for a physical properties challenge. The data is currently clearing legal review at GSK and a challenge is forthcoming in the immediate future. This will include pKa prediction as well as logD between (diverse) organic phases. Details will be posted as soon as legal review is complete.
