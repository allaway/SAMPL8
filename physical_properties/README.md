# The SAMPL8 physical properties challenge

We recently finalized work with GSK on data collection for a physical properties challenge. The data recently cleared legal review at GSK and we are now making challenge details and input files available. The challenge will include pKa prediction as well as logD between (diverse) organic phases.

For details on [SAMPL8 physical properties dataset collection, refer to this GCC/EuroSAMPL talk](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245127]) by Aakankschit Nandkeolyar and Matthew Bahr. Full details of the experiments, along with the results of the measurements, are available in a paper draft which will be submitted after the challenge closes.
