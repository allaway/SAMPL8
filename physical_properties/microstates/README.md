## SAMPL7 Molecules

23 small molecules are assigned moleculed IDs in the form of `SAMPL8-XX` from SAMPL8-1 to SAMPL8-23. This directory will be updated at a later time to include their enumerated microstates.

Also provided are the molecules in Tripos MOL2 (`.mol2`), SDF (`.sdf`), and PDB (`.pdb`) file format.

Please note, the microstate lists that will be provided here (at a later time) may not be comprehensive.

### Manifest
- [`make_mol2_sdf_files.ipynb`](make_mol2_sdf_files.ipynb) - The jupyter notebook used to generate the MOL2, SDF, and PDB files for molecules using OpenEye toolkits and the SMILES strings and codenames found in the `SAMPL8_molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv` files.
- [`SAMPL8_molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv`](SAMPL8_molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv) - A `.CSV` file that indicates SAMPL8 challenge molecule IDs and SMILES.
