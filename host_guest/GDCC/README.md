# The SAMPL8 GDCC Challenge

For SAMPL7, the Gibb group is contributing binding data for five
guests to two Gibb Deep Cavity Cavitand (GDCC) hosts related to the "octa acid"
hosts seen in prior challenges. One is the [TEMOA ("OAH") host seen in SAMPL6](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL6/blob/master/host_guest_description.md) and the other, named TEETOA, differs by the replacement of a methyl at the cavity rim with an ethyl.

## Challenge timing details

The SAMPL8 GDCC challenge design is now finalized (as of Oct. 14, 2020) with the details as given below.
The challenge submission deadline is Feb. 4, 2021.
The challenge consists of predicting binding free energies of five compounds to both of TEMOA and TEETOA.

Additional files/inputs will be provided in the near future.

## The SAMPL8 GDCC Challenge: Sterics and flexibility

The two hosts shown below, tetramethyl octa acid (TEMOA) and tetraethyl octa acid (TEETOA) differ only in the functionalization around the cavity rim.

The Gibb group will examine the binding of five guests: four negatively charged, and one likely neutral.
As in SAMPL7, all binding constants will be determined in (10 mM) sodium phosphate buffer, here at pH 11.5.
Each of these new binding determinations will be carried out in triplicate using ITC, and where necessary, verified by NMR (or measured by NMR, for very weak binders).

(Tentative:) For all compounds for which binding is being determined by ITC, binding enthalpy measurements will also be available. Thus, binding enthalpy values can optionally be submitted and will be judged as data is available (that is, for most compounds).

### Additional technical details

Buffer conditions are 10 mM sodium phosphate at pH 11.5. The plan is to gather data in triplicate with fresh solutions of host and guest on each occasion.  Also, all hosts samples are probed by one of either two ways to determine the waters of hydration in each sample.  This can be as high so this analysis is a requirement to avoid bad data.

For positively charged guests, chloride salts are being used.

### Disclaimers

General disclaimer: The protonation state of the host may in some cases be not completely certain, and participants are also encouraged to carefully select guest protonation states. Protonation states and conformations may or may not match those of the files provided here.

# What's here

- `source_files`: Source files provided by Bruce Gibb and Paolo Suating, giving structures of hosts and guests. All other files provided here will be derived from these as we will document here.


## What's coming
- Submission file format (likely to match SAMPL7)
- Submission instructions
- Curated PDB/mol2/SDF files we will generate in a uniform manner from the source data.
