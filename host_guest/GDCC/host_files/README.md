# Hosts for the SAMPL8 GDCC Sterics and Flexibility Challenge

Provided are the hosts for this challenge in PDB, Tripos MOL2 and SDF file formats. The hosts are codenamed from `TEMOA` and `TEEtOA`.

## What's here

- `.mol2`, `.sdf` and `.pdb` files for all guests: These were auto-generated from Gibbs-provided host [source files](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/host_guest/GDCC/source_files/Hosts) via `input_maker.ipynb` using the OpenEye toolkits.
- `Assign_Charge.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to assign AM1BCC charges to the host `mol2` files.
