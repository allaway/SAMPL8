# Guests for the SAMPL8 GDCC Sterics and Flexibility Challenge

Provided are the guests for this challenge in PDB, Tripos MOL2 and SDF file formats. The guests are codenamed from `G1` through `G5`.

## What's here

- `guest_smiles.txt`: Text file of SMILES generated from Gibbs-provided [source_files](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/host_guest/GDCC/source_files).
- `guest_smiles.csv`: csv file of SMILES generated from Gibbs-provided [source_files](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/host_guest/GDCC/source_files).
- `.mol2`, `.sdf` and `.pdb` files for all guests: These were auto-generated from the SMILES (`guest_smiles.txt`) via `input_maker.ipynb` using the OpenEye toolkits.
