# The SAMPL8 CB8 "Drugs of Abuse" challenge

The CB8 "drugs of abuse" challenge focuses on binding of CB8 to nine guests which are drugs of abuse, including morphine, hydromorphine, methamphetamine, cocaine and others. Binding has been experimentally characterized, a provisional patent filed, and the Isaacs group is preparing a paper for publication. Experimental details are forthcoming shortly.

## More on the host

This host-guest series is based on the host cucurbit[8]uril (CB8), which was used in SAMPL3 and SAMPL6 (as previously summarized in the [SAMPL3 overview](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-012-9554-1) and the [SAMPL6 overview](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-018-0170-6)). CB8 is the eight-membered relative of cucurbit[7]uril, which was used in several other prior SAMPL challenges. Background information on CB8 may be found in a number of publications aside from the SAMPL overview papers, including DOI 10.1021/jp2110067, 10.1002/chem.201403405, and 10.1021/ja055013x.

## Disclaimer

Note that we have typically selected, or attempted to select, reasonable protonation states and conformers of the hosts and guests, but these may be controversial, uncertain, or change upon binding, so participants are encouraged to exercise care in selecting which states are modeled. Typically selection of protonation states, tautomers and conformers is one major place where participant protocols differ and lead to different downstream results.
