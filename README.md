# The SAMPL8 Blind Prediction Challenges for Computational Chemistry
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/271066350.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/271066350)



Challenge details, inputs, and results for the SAMPL8 series (phase) of challenges. Each individual SAMPL8 challenge may be broken up into multiple stages.

See the [SAMPL website](https://samplchallenges.github.io/) for information on the Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) series of challenges as a whole. This repository focuses specifically on the SAMPL8 series of challenges. Additionally, see the [SAMPL community](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl/?page=1&size=20) on Zenodo for content related to the SAMPL series of challenges. If you wish to use Zenodo to post your presentation slides, datasets, and/or other SAMPL related material, and get a DOI for them, please upload to the community [here](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl/?page=1&size=20) so that your content will be listed.

Because these files are available publicly, we have no record of who downloads them. Therefore, you should sign up for notifications. Specifically, if you want to receive updates if we uncover any problems, it is imperative that you either (a) [sign up for the SAMPL e-mail list](https://mailchi.mp/e36018629725/sampl8-sign-ups), or (b) sign up for notifications of changes to this GitHub repository (the Watch button, above); ideally you would do both.

Please note that some aspects of the SAMPL7 series of challenges are still ongoing, but as we are launching a new host-guest challenge that marks the beginning of the SAMPL8 series of challenges, so we have opened up this repository.

## Acknowledging and citing SAMPL

If you've benefitted from our work on the SAMPL series of challenges, please be sure to acknowledge our SAMPL NIH grant in any publications/presentations. This funded host-guest experiments, as well as our work organizing and administrating these challenges. You may acknowledge SAMPL by saying something like, "We appreciate the National Institutes of Health for its support of the SAMPL project via R01GM124270 to David L. Mobley (UC Irvine)."

We also ask you to cite the SAMPL dataset(s) you used. These are versioned on Zenodo, and the latest DOI is here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/271066350.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/271066350) . Click through for access to all data releases. You may cite these sets by their DOI.

Of course, we also appreciate it if you cite any overview/experimental papers relevant to the particular SAMPL challenge you participated in.

## What's here
- Host-guest challenge files for the CB8 challenge.
- [Host-guest participation instructions](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/blob/master//host_guest_instructions.md) with information on the submissions format, etc. Submission templates are available in the the subdirectories for individual host-guest systems.

## What's coming

At a later date, we will announce details of other SAMPL8 host-guest challenges, including a likely cyclodextrin-derivative challenge with the Gilson lab, and another OctaAcid-based challenge with the Gibb lab. These are currently on hold due to COVID-19-related lab shutdowns.

We are also in the process of sorting out details of other SAMPL challenges in the physical properties area and potentially also on protein-ligand binding, but these are still awaiting dataset collection and/or construction so no details can be announced yet.

## Changes and Data Set Versions

### Releases
- **Release 0.1** ([DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4029560](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4029560), Sept. 14, 2020): Release version of the info that was here prior to the closing of the [CB8 "drugs of abuse" challenge](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/host_guest/CB8) from Isaacs.

### Changes not in a release

- Add SAMPL8 CB8 submissions, user map, utilities, functions, and analysis scripts; add/update README files at all directories in SAMPL8 repo.(9/25/20)
- Add experimental measurements and link for CB8 experimental publication. (9/25/20)
- Updates submission files (give unique method names and edit ext) (10/1/20)
- Updates analysis script (10/1/20)
- Add preliminary results (plots, tables, etc) for the host-guest challenge. Currently only includes CB8. (10/1/20)

## Challenge construction

### Overview

The SAMPL8 phase of challenges includes at least several new host-guest challenges (CB8, cyclodextrin derivatives, and Gibb's deep cavity cavitands) with details on the latter two awaiting experimental data collection after COVID-19 lab reopenings. We hope to have a logP/logD/pKa challenge or challenges and perhaps also protein-ligand, but this will depend on experimental details and data availability.


### The CB8 challenge

The CB8 "drugs of abuse" challenge focuses on binding of CB8 to seven guests which are drugs of abuse, including morphine, hydromorphine, methamphetamine, cocaine and others. Binding has been experimentally characterized, a provisional patent filed, and the Isaacs group has prepared a paper for publication [available here](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/In_Vitro_and_In_Vivo_Sequestration_of_Phencyclidine_by_Me4Cucurbit_8_uril/12994004). Experimental results/data is available [in this repository](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/blob/master/host_guest/Analysis/ExperimentalMeasurements/).

**Deadline**: The deadline for CB8 submissions is September 15, 2020. [The submission format is available](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/blob/master/host_guest/CB8/CB8_submissions.txt).
